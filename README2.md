# Meicho 2 - Engineering Log & Implementation Notes

**Date:** 2024-06-10

## Service Layer & Custom Hooks Scaffolding

- Created `src/services/` for all Supabase-related business logic (entries, media, tags, etc.).
- Created `src/hooks/` for custom React hooks that wrap service functions and manage state, loading, and errors.
- This structure will ensure maintainability, scalability, and clean separation of concerns as the project grows.
